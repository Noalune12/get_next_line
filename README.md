# Main goal
- Reads a line from a file or from standard input, taking into account the newline character (\n).
- Returns that line, and when called again, reads the next line.
- Manages buffers efficiently to avoid unnecessary memory usage, and ensures no memory leaks.
- Handles cases where there is no more data to read (end of file).

# Bonus Features:
- Handling multiple file descriptors
